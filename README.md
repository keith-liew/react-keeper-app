## Setup
- Project environment:
    -npm installed 


## Usage
- On project terminal
    - install dependencies `npm install`
    - start the app `npm start`


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Lesson Learned
- Create a simple react app
- Create react app with reuseable module
- Use react hooks(useState) to create react state
- Use setState to update data and complex data
- Pass state and setState hooks to the child component
- React concept of controlled component to control single source of truth
- Concept of declarative and imperative programming
- Make good use of conditional rendering with ternary operator
- Use ES6 functions(map, filter, spread operator, destructuring) to enhance the development experience


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by Angela Yu.
- This project was based on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

## P.S.
- In order to avoid version incompatibility issues from the course, the project was developed based on react v16

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
